# CSCI-2467-Java-Programming-1
Columbus State Assignments

I used Textpad for all of the assignments in order to learn how to type lines without the aid of auto-fill.

An individual can access the files by using a Java IDE, such as TextPad, eclipse or IntelliJ.

Once the IDE is installed, the next step would be to complie and run the Java file from within the application of choice.

There are alternative ways to write the majority of the Code, but I wrote the code freely, however, based off the professor's

request.

Please feel free to comment.
